You can set the level of BOM maintenance to generic article level (recommended) or to variant article level.
Generic article level BOM maintenance (recommended)
As a default in Fashion Management, you create a BOM on generic article level by maintaining deviation quantity and include/exclude segment value. The same values are copied to the variants of the generic article for header and components.
Variant level BOM maintenance
For backward compatibility reasons, you can decide to continue maintaining BOM's at variant article level. This can be useful if you used BOM's in your retail system at variant level, and activate Fashion Management. If you set the level of BOM maintenance to variant article level, creating a BOM at generic article level doesn't have any impact on variant article BOM's.

When the original retail price is determined and saved for an article and store, this value is not updated the next time automatic sales price revaluation is called. The original retail price is only updated for the articles of a store if these articles do not have an original retail price yet. The net and gross sales prices are always updated.
Articles are not revaluated during automatic sales price revaluation in the following cases:
-Articles without stock
If the articles cannot be revaluated due to one of the reasons described above, the original retail price is determined and saved if it is not available yet.
-No change in sales price between two calls of sales price revaluation

"Purchasing Info Record Number of Days for First Reminder-Expediter","Number of days representing the time interval at which reminders or urging letters/messages (may also be termed ""chasers"", ""hasteners"" (UK) or ""expediters"" (USA)) are to be issued to the supplier.
Use
A negative number of days means that a reminder is to be issued to the supplier n days prior to a certain date (for example, the delivery date or the deadline for submission of quotations).
A positive number of days means that a letter or message urging delivery or submission of a quotation etc. is to be issued n days after the due date.
Procedure
In the case of purchasing documents, the time intervals are defaulted from the purchasing info record or, if one does not exist, from the material master record.
Dependencies
The basis for the reminder intervals is the delivery date or deadline for submission of quotations etc.
In the event of several reminder levels, the days must be set out in ascending order of time, without gaps.","Approved","","","","","Rachel.Merrill@hanes.com:Rachel Merrill-Product Data Domain Lead;","","Purchasing Info Record","","MDG-EINA-MAHN1"

Similar to the master data model for the entire supply chain network, a subnetwork consists of nodes (that is, location products) and arcs (which are used to model the transport links between the location products). You define the subnetwork to which a location product belongs in the location product master data. You can define subnetworks for product groups or regions, or for any other property of locations, products, or location products.

When planners start a planning session, they select one or more subnetworks that are to be taken into account by the planning algorithm. This therefore defines the set of location products that are to be planned.

Variances can only be calculated for the orders for which a variance key has been entered. This key is defaulted through the costing view in the material master record.
If you have activated variance calculation in the variance key, the value of the scrap is calculated at target cost  and subtracted from the actual costs before the variances are determined.
Procedure
If you are working with cost object hierarchies, the cost object category determines how variances are calculated.
�If the costs collected at hierarchy level are distributed to the assigned orders ( product cost collectors or manufacturing orders),  you must enter a variance key in each order so that the R/3 System can calculate variances for the assigned orders.
�If the costs collected at the hierarchy level are settled as price differences, you must store a variance key in the cost object nodes and calculate variances for the entire cost object hierarchy.
Dependencies

Use
You can predefine shipping/receiving points in the system, based on different combinations of
� Plants
� Shipping conditions
� Loading groups
During delivery processing, the shipping/receiving point is the most important criterion that you use to select deliveries.
A delivery can be shipped from only one shipping point or received at only one receiving point.
If you want to provide more detailed information about a shipping point you can specify a loading point (for example, one of a number of different loading ramps).
Example
If, for example, you want to ship refrigerated goods to a certain customer by rail, the system proposes a shipping point with a suitable location and equipment for loading refrigerated goods onto rail cars.
Procedure
The system can propose a shipping/receiving point. If valid alternatives are predefined in your system, you can change the shipping/receiving point manually.
You can define a user-specific default value for the shipping point in the user parameter VST.","Approved","","","","","Rachel.Merrill@hanes.com:Rachel Merrill-Product Data Domain Lead;","","Site","","MDG-T001W-VSTEL"

Use
Added-function source determination (AFSD) comprises both the implementation of an availability check as well as a normal source determination process in a connected APO system.
Note
Even if you do not have APO system connected, you can still carry out an availability check in the standard system. To do so, choose the setting 'Added-Function Source Determination with Existing Sources of Supply'.
Dependencies
The following procedures are available:
�AFSD with no sources
If the standard system finds no valid sources of supply when carrying out a normal source determination process, this process can be continued in a connected APO system. If supplying plants are found as potential sources in that system, the APO system then carries out an availability check, the results of which are returned to the standard system.
�AFSD with existing sources
If the standard system finds valid sources of supply when carrying out the normal source determination process, an availability check is carried out for any supplying plants found.
If an APO system is connected to your standard system, an additional source determination process can be carried out there. If supplying plants are found as potential sources in that system, the APO system carries out an availability check, the results of which are returned to the standard system.
�No AFSD
If the standard system finds valid sources of supply when carrying out the normal source determination process, no availability check is then carried out with respect to any supplying plants found","Approved","","","","","Rachel.Merrill@hanes.com:Rachel Merrill-Product Data Domain Lead;","","Site","","MDG-T001W-SOURCING"

"Item category (bill of material)","Categorization of the items in a BOM according to set criteria, such as whether they refer to an object (for example, material master or document info record) or whether they are kept in stock.
This categorization allows you to process data that is relevant to the individual items in a BOM. The item category is used to control field selection, default values for BOM maintenance, triggering of specific system activities, and so on.
- Stock item
This item category is used to manage material data that allows an item to be kept in stock.
- Document item
This item category is used to manage document data that allows you to process original application data (for example, graphics created with a graphics program).
- Class item (for configurable BOMs)
In configurable material BOMs, you can enter a class as a placeholder for selectable items. The class can contain either materials or documents.
When you assign characteristic values while configuring the BOM, the system replaces the node with an object that has the same values as those assigned to the characteristic of the configuration. This makes BOMs with a larger number of variants easier to maintain, as you do not have to enter all items manually and assign a selection condition to them.
Class items can be relevant to MRP.
- PM structure element
This item is used to structure an equipment (PM assembly) for design purposes only.

"Update of Activity Consumption in the Quantity Structure","Setting for updating the consumption of activities and processes in the actual quantity structure. Three different settings are available:
'0' = Update is not active
'1' = Update is active but not relevant to price determination. Consumption is updated in the quantity structure but not taken into account upon price determination.
'2' = Update is active and relevant to price determination. Variances between the activity prices/process prices posted during the period and the actual price at the end of the period are adjusted subsequently.
Consequences
If the update is relevant for price determination in a plant, all allocations to orders that are settled to materials are posted with a constant price throughout the period. The valuation strategy is invalidated inasmuch as a price is calculated according to the strategy only for the first activity allocation. For all subsequent allocations, the constant price is used, even if the strategy would dictate otherwise.
The update settings can only be used together with Actual Costing.
Data can not be updated correctly if the setting changes within the period. (price determination would generate incorrect debits to materials)
Dependencies
If you activate activity consumption update in the quantity structure with the with (Activity update relevant to price determination), the differences for the cost centers/processes are subsequently debited to the relevant material. Therefore, if you activate the activity consumption update in the quantity structure  with setting '2', you cannot complete the step 'revaluate actual prices' during period closing for Cost Object Controlling as this would subsequently debit the material twice.","Approved","","","","","Rachel.Merrill@hanes.com:Rachel Merrill-Product Data Domain Lead;","","Site","","MDG-T001W-MGVLAUPD"

In certain countries, the bank account number takes on this function; then there are no bank numbers and the bank data is managed using the account number.
For data medium exchange, you may find it useful to be able to enter foreign business partners without a bank number, even if there are bank numbers in the country in question. In this case, the bank key can be assigned internally.

To convert a quantity, whose unit of measure is not the same as the base unit of measure, into the base unit of measure, the system requires a quotient:
Enter the number of units of the alternative unit of measure (denominator) that corresponds to the number of units of the base unit of measure (numerator).
You may enter only whole numbers in the numerator and denominator fields; that is, if 3.14 m� correspond to one piece, you must enter integer multiples (314 m� = 100 PC).
