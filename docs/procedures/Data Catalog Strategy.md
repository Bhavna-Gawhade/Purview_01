# Data Catalog Strategy Documentation

---

## 1. Introduction:
   The Data Catalog Strategy serves as a comprehensive framework for managing and utilizing data assets within our organization. This documentation outlines our approach to cataloging data, including the processes involved, the types of data sources scanned, and how we leverage the catalog for various purposes such as lineage development and data governance.

## 2. Utilization of the Catalog:
   Our approach to utilizing the data catalog involves scanning different data sources to capture metadata of assets within the system. When a scan occurs, it retrieves essential information about the assets, such as their structure, attributes, and relationships. Subsequently, we enrich these assets with additional context and annotations to enhance their usability and relevance.

## 4. Asset Collections:
   We organize assets into collections whenever feasible to facilitate better management and discovery. By grouping related assets together, users can easily navigate the catalog and find relevant data entities. Collections may be based on various criteria such as business function, data domain, or project affiliation.

## 5. Glossary Management:
   Our data catalog includes a glossary section dedicated to capturing definitions related to tables and fields. This glossary serves as a centralized repository of data terminology, ensuring consistency and clarity in communication across the organization. Definitions are maintained and updated collaboratively to reflect changes in the data landscape.

## 6. Conclusion:
   The Data Catalog Strategy outlines our systematic approach to managing data assets, from scanning diverse sources to enriching metadata and organizing assets into collections. By leveraging the catalog and its associated glossary, we empower users to discover, understand, and utilize data effectively, thereby enhancing data-driven decision-making and fostering a culture of data governance and stewardship.
