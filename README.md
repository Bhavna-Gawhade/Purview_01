<!-- DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS -->

# Design Considerations

Every good application has taken the problem statement, goals and objectives and other considerations into account as it is designed and implemented.  Any serious project is able to provide answers the following questions to minimize the amount of rework or redesign that is required once development has been started.

| Name | Description | Overview | 
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| Solution overview | Describe the solution in 2-3 sentences. |   |
| Budget | Are there any budgeting constraints for this solution that the architecture team should be aware of?  |   |
| Problem Statement | Clearly define the business problem or challenge that this project aims to solve and address. This should be in terms of technical or business shortfalls that is preventing the organization from realizing value. |   | 
| Business Goals and Objectives | What objectives and value is the business expecting to be delivered from this analytics solution?  |   |
| Resourcing |  Does your project have the technical resources to successfully develop this solution from an infrastructure and engineering side?  P |  |
| Project Deliverables | You should be able to exactly quantify the outcomes and artifacts that are expected from this project.  Some examples of this are reports/dashboards, new datasets, ML Models or other applications | |

<!-- SOLUTION OVERVIEW -->

# Solution Overview

A complete review of the project to provide context for some of the design decisions, explanation for some of the technical implementations and other key pieces of information that are essential to understanding the work contained in this repository. This includes but is not limited to the following points:

- **Describe the features:** Outline the key features of your application, including any unique or innovative functionality that sets it apart from similar solutions. Be sure to highlight the benefits that users can expect to gain from these features.
- **Include project-specific information:** If your application is part of a larger project or development effort, provide some context about the project, including the timeline, milestones, and any other relevant information that will help readers understand the scope and objectives of the project.
- **Execution Flow:** Cover the typical flow of any application invocation or processing pipeline.  This can discuss different error handling that has been implemented and other process structure.
- **Repository Structure:** If there are any unique organization or formatting aspects to this application, please call this out.

<!-- DATASETS -->

# Datasets

When designing an application that relies on data, it's important to consider the datasets that will be used to power the application. Describe the data storage requirements for the application, including the type of database used and any specific storage needs for images, videos, or other media.  This relates to both the data sources, intermediate datasets and the outputs that feed any reporting.
